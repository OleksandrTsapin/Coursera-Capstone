# Coursera_Capstone

This repository mainly used for the Capstone Project for IBM Data Science Professional Certificate program on Coursera.

This project aims to equip you with the necessary skills to solve problems based on location data. For example, to compare different neighborhoods in terms of a service. Search for potential explanation of why a neighborhood is popular. The cause of complaints in another neighborhood, or anything else related to neighborhoods. Hence the name of the capstone project will be the battle of the neighborhoods.
